### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where Kaya teaches a younger cousin how to set a snare, explaining not just the mechanics but the philosophy of taking only what is given.
- Draft a 'field guide' entry written by the man in the trailer, describing the valley, its resources, and the 'natives' he observes, revealing his fundamental misunderstandings.
- Compose a monologue for Elu, addressed to Kaya's absent father, explaining why she has chosen her path of subtle resistance for her granddaughter.
- Imagine a chapter from the perspective of the forest itself, personified, sensing the new imbalance and the two different human energies within it.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive map of the valley, tagging locations with ecological data, Kaya's observations, and the intruder's actions, visualizing the clash of worldviews spatially.
- Create a text-based simulation where the player, as Kaya, must manage resources (food, cordage, time) and choose responses to escalating intrusions, where overt conflict leads to game-over.
